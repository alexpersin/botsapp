Chrome in Docker
================

An experiment to get Chrome running inside a Docker container. I've mainly following the first link below in the command line, the Dockerfile here is following another link but I think it's linux specific. With the first link I successfully got the GUI link working (showing the googly eyes) but not running chrome due to `Failed to connect to the bus: Failed to connect to socket /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket: No such file or directory`

Yowsup no longer works due to restrictions by WhatsApp. The most promising alternative is one of the Python libraries that wraps around the WhatsApp Web API like [this one](https://github.com/mukulhase/WebWhatsapp-Wrapper). All of these require a WhatsApp app running somewhere to route traffic through. We could run the app in an emulator or a Docker on the server.

## Setup
1) `cd` to where you want the yowsup library to live
2) `$ git clone https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup.git`
3) `$ cd yowsup`
4) `$ sudo python setup.py install`
